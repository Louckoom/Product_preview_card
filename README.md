## My process

- Begin with semantic HTML.
- Import fonts.
- Create CSS link on HTML.
- Install Sass to write using SCSS.
- Write the mobile version of styling using SCSS.
- Adapt for desktop version using media query.
- Adjust some padding and spacing issues.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Variable
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned

- I learnt how to use media query.
- I learnt how to write SCSS file.
- I learnt more about flexbox.

### Continued development

To improve it will be useful to streamline the intermediate media query between 375px and 1440px.
